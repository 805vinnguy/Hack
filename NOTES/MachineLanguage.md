# Machine Language

## Universality

+ same **hardware** can run many different **software** programs
+ theory: universal turing machine: general machine able to run all possible programs
+ practice: von neumann architecture: practical architecture for general computing machine

## Elements

1. Operations (what instructions to do)
2. Program Counter (which instruction to do at some given stage in time)
3. Addressing (tell hardware what to operate on)

## Instruction

|0100010|0011|0010|
|:-:    |:-: |:-: |
|ADD    |R3  |R2  |

> *Interpretation 1*: The symbolic form doesn't exist but is just a convenient mneumonic to present machine language instructions to humans.

> *Interpretation 2*: This symbolic form allows humans to write machine language instructions using assembly language and have an assembler program convert it to bit-form.
